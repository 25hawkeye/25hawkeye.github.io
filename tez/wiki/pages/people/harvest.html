        <p>
           Cashier/Harvest (OST maker, main suggester, and wiki maker) 
           He isn't an official dev but he is a good person to hire (HIRE HIM HE IS GOOD WITH SOUNDTRACKS SUGGESTIONS ETC, tbh the owner needa stop yapping and listen to him.) 
           Harvest also has a YouTube channel, but for now he doesn't post as he is working on an animation for TEZ.
