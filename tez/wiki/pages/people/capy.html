          Terezkaknappova06 or CapyPaw is the founder of TEZ. 
          CapyPaw has a discord and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@_capypawz_">tiktok</a>, where you can find them. 
          She is a 13 year old person, making her really impressive honestly for making a game. CapyPaw's pronouns are she/they, do not use he or anything else on CapyPaw in that case. CapyPaw is infact a furry, if you hate on furries you're just not a normal person, because they honestly don't do anything. 
          If you are not sure what a furry, then please check out this wikipedia on them: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry_fandom" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia">Furry Fandom</a>
