        Roblox was founded in 2004 by the people David Baszucki and Erik Casse. 
        Roblox was released in 2006 which started a whole new discovery on your computer back then. 
        Roblox is now a multi-billionare dollar company with a net-work of 45 billion US dollars.

        In 2023 on July 10th the creator of TEZ created The Experimental Zone. 
        The game at first was not popular at all, not even noticed. 
        Now it is slowly growing into a bigger community, with a community of at least 200+ (estimated) people. 
        The Experimental Zone has a lore based genre to it, leaving it at about one of the top furry games on Roblox, with little to no players.
