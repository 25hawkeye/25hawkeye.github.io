        In 2023 on July 10th the creator of TEZ created The Experimental Zone. 
        The game at first was not popular at all, not even noticed. 
        Now it is slowly growing into a bigger community, with a community of at least 200+ (estimated) people. 
        The Experimental Zone has a lore based genre to it, leaving it at about one of the top furry games on Roblox, with little to no players.
